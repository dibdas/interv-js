The react-dom package exports a number of methods that can be used to interact with the DOM. These methods include:

render(): This method is used to render a React component into the DOM.
hydrate(): This method is used to hydrate a React component that has already been rendered into the DOM.
findDOMNode(): This method is used to get the underlying DOM node for a React component.
unmountComponentAtNode(): This method is used to unmount a React component from the DOM.
createPortal(): This method is used to create a portal, which is a way to render a React component into a different DOM hierarchy.
flushSync(): This method is used to flush all pending DOM updates synchronously.
